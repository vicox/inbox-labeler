/**
 * Who is allowed to change the schema, and when.
 *
 * The rule these tests hold is operational rather than cryptographic, and it is
 * still a security rule: **a request from the internet must never be what causes
 * DDL to run.** The first request after a deploy is an arbitrary one, several
 * instances would race to be it, and a migration that failed halfway would do so
 * inside somebody's page load with nobody watching. So production checks and
 * refuses, and an operator runs `npm run db:migrate` as a step they can see.
 *
 * Development keeps migrating, because a checkout has to work after `npm install`
 * and a developer's own machine is not the thing being protected.
